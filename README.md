# Wild Welcome

## Description
Wild Welcome will launch initially in Rwanda, capitalising on the country's strong track record in sustainable tourism and conservation. The platform will concentrate on areas surrounding Volcanoes National Park and Akagera National Park, key destinations that align with Rwanda's eco-tourism priorities. This strategic focus allows for a controlled pilot in a supportive regulatory and conservation environment, minimising entry risks and enabling refinement of the platform before broader expansion.

In the long term, Wild Welcome aims to scale into other African regions with strong ecotourism and conservation potential. The platform's primary target users are wildlife photographers, both amateurs and professionals, who need affordable, well-equipped accommodations near prime wildlife areas. By focusing on this niche, Wild Welcome can tailor its offerings and build a passionate user community that supports both the platform and its mission. Secondary users include general eco-tourists and nature enthusiasts seeking sustainable, immersive travel.

Technically, the project will begin with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that includes a user-friendly website and mobile-responsive interface, offering core features such as listings, bookings, communication tools, and initial conservation integrations. This phased approach supports lean testing, quick iteration, and efficient validation of both market interest and impact potential before scaling further.
