**Time Started**: 15:20  
**Issue**: TypeError in get_current_user - validate() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given

## Session Goal
Fix the User model validation error that's causing /auth/me endpoint to fail with 500 error.

## Investigation Log
### [15:20] - Error Analysis
- Error: `TypeError: validate() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given`
- Location: `dependencies.py:44` in `return User(**user_data)`
- Issue: Pydantic v2.5.0 incompatibility with User model definition

### [15:22] - Root Cause
- User model has `PyObjectId` field with custom validation
